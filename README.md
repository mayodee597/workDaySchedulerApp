A 3rd -party API Work Day Scheduler

This is a simple Calendar App which allowed me as the user to schedule my events around a 24-hour period.  
The App runs in a browser and features a dynamically updated HTM and CSS applications powered by JQuery.  The Moment.js Library was used to work with date and time.
Each time block is color coded to indicate whether event is in the past, present, or in future.  I can input event/events into a time block and save it.  Each time my Calendar page was refreshed, the text of that event was saved in a local storage and the saved events persisted while browser is up.  
My urlâ€™s of the deployed application and the GitHub repository were submitted.
